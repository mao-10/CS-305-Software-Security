# CS-305-Software-Security
# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
# What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
# Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Artemis Financial is a finance management company that is looking to build in more security into their process. They want to add more security in their login process, communications, and file verification.  When looking at their software vulnerabilities, I saw that they had many dependencies. Some of them included using outdated software that made them susceptible to security risks. I recommended versions of software that would eliminate vulnerabities. To check if new vulnerabilities were introduced by my solutions, I reran Maven's dependency check and also checked for errors. Coding securely is important because it reduces risk and protets important data. In the future, I will continue to use dependency-check because it was quite useful in seeing vulnerabilities. This assignment shows my considerations for security and knowledge on software security.
